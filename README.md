I’ve never worked with JavaScript or web development before—but this week, I built a functional Chrome extension to block YouTube Shorts from my feed. Here’s why and how I did it:



The Problem: Why Block Shorts?

Shorts are based on the infinite scroll (developed by Mr. Aza Razkin, shout out to the amazing work done by the Earth Species Project). They are meant to be addictive. The endless scroll and 15-second dopamine hits absolutely DEMOLISH your ability to focus on the task at hand, making it harder to engage in deep work or meaningful content. As a student juggling mechatronics and my personal interest in data science, I needed to reclaim my time. While existing solutions existed, I wanted to learn by doing—because nothing beats getting your hands dirty.



The (Unlikely) Solution

a. Use prompt engineering (shoutout to AI tools!) to troubleshoot code - while AI often makes up information, it works quite well when you provide it your own code and need help in debugging.

b. Watch YouTube tutorials on Chrome extensions - being in 2025, YouTube has tutorials for everything! It was not that difficult to actually figure out what needed to be done, and what 

c. Write a script that detects and hides Shorts elements in real-time using Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.

Tools used (I had never used any of these before): JavaScript, Chrome Extension API, MutationObserver



This project wasn’t just about coding. It tested how I work with concepts and ideas that I have never used before. I worked with tools that I had never heard of, in a programming language that I have never formally learnt. Yet in the end, I managed to get the extension up and running.

I still ran into many code errors, as it was my first time. But you can always google the error you have, read documentation and figure out the way forward. 



Overall 10/10 learning experience. Doing something new allows you to explore so much more that you expect. My takeaway: Look forward to unexpected trials, they can teach you a lot :D
